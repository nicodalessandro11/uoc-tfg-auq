## üêõ Fix | 2025-05-25 | Granularity/area sync: instant, robust, no race
    
    - Updated granularity change logic in components/granularity-selector.tsx to clear area and update both state and URL in a single handler
    - Removed global/effect-based area clearing on granularity change, preventing race conditions and double updates
    - Ensured area selection persists and only clears when user changes level, never on unrelated state changes
    - Fixed issue where UI/URL could get out of sync or require double-tap to change level
    
    This checkpoint guarantees immediate, reliable sync between area, level, and URL, with a professional user experience.

## üêõ Fix | 2025-05-25| Robust city/area state sync and URL update logic
    
    - Refactored setSelectedCity in contexts/map-context.tsx to update the URL before state, ensuring correct sync between UI, state, and URL
    - Fixed bug where changing city with an area selected would revert to the previous city due to race condition between state and URL effects
    - Removed redundant effect that double-loaded data on city/granularity change, preventing race conditions and UI flicker
    - Ensured area is always cleared and removed from URL when city changes, and that all map data, filters, and points reload as expected
    - Selecting the same city now does nothing, preventing unnecessary data clearing
    
    This checkpoint ensures robust, professional state and URL management for city/area selection, eliminating desynchronization and bounce-back issues.

## üì¶ Feature | 2025-05-24 | Checkpoint: stateless area selection & highlight sync
    
    - All area selection and polygon highlight logic now fully stateless and URL-driven (components/map-view.tsx, components/leaflet-map.jsx)
    - Changing level (district/neighborhood) resets area selection and removes 'area' param from URL
    - Polygon highlight is always cleared when no area is selected, preventing stale UI
    - Lays the foundation for robust, predictable navigation and state sync across the app
    
    Checkpoint commit: ensures future features build on a clean, stateless, and user-friendly selection model.

## Checkpoint: working persistent point features state (per city/granularity) and code ready for cleanup
