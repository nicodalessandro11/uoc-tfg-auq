This update improves maintainability and transparency in running parts of the pipeline independently.

## üì¶ Feature | 2025-04-15 | Added ETL scripts and processed data for BCN & Madrid

- Created `load_districts.py` and `load_neighbourhoods.py` for both Barcelona and Madrid under `data/scripts/`
- Generated `insert_ready_*.json` files with cleaned and WKT-wrapped geometries in `data/processed/`
- Ensured all districts and neighbourhoods are standardized and mapped to city IDs
- Added seed.sql to initialize PostGIS schema with all required tables and constraints
- Added `test_geometry_integrity.py` to validate WKT consistency between raw and processed files
- Includes Makefile commands (`etl`, `test`) for pipeline reproducibility

Enables complete ETL and test pipeline for loading and validating geospatial data per city.

## üìÑ Docs | 2025-04-15 | Added commit message template for project documentation

## üóÉÔ∏è DB | 2025-04-15 | Added full PostGIS schema and unified views

- Added database/schema.sql with table definitions for cities, districts, neighbourhoods, indicators, and point_features
- Added database/views.sql including 'geographical_unit_view' to unify all geo levels
- Enables reproducibility and setup of Supabase schema from scratch

## üì¶ Data Pipeline | 2025-04-15 | ETL pipeline + Supabase config for geographical data

- Added working .env and .env.example with Supabase URL and service key
- Removed supabase-password.txt and old placeholder files
- Created ETL scripts for Barcelona and Madrid (districts + neighbourhoods)
- Prepared upload script using supabase-py to send data from JSON to Supabase
- Updated ingest_data.py and requirements.txt to support ETL workflow
- Added real data sources: GeoJSON/TopoJSON files for BCN and MAD

This commit sets up a complete ETL-to-database pipeline for geospatial data ingestion.

## üîê Config | 2025-04-15 | Added Supabase credentials to .env.example and removed exposed password

- Updated .env.example with SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY placeholders
- Ensured local .env includes real credentials (not committed)
- Deleted supabase-password.txt to prevent accidental exposure

## üîê Config | 2025-04-15 | Added safe .env.example and removed password file

- Added .env.example with Supabase placeholders
- Updated .gitignore to exclude .env from versioning
- Removed supabase-password.txt to avoid exposed credentials

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup | 2025-04-14 | Initial backend + Supabase integration setup

- Deleted placeholder .env.example (replaced with working .env file locally)
- Modified backend entrypoint and database logic (main.py, db.py)
- Updated backend/frontend Dockerfiles to align with Supabase config
- Adjusted docker-compose to reflect real env variables
- Created documentation stub for methods (docs/methods_resources.md)
- Added supabase-password.txt (‚ö†Ô∏è this should be ignored or encrypted later)
- Prepared requirements.txt for deployment

## 2025-04-14 | Initial project structure from CA3 template
